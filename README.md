# Tech Blog Using Sequelize, Express and MVC protacall. 

A simple blog site that allows a user login and interact with a blog about technology. Contains a dashboard to view all posts, and a profile to view thier own post. 

### This Stack Uses:
-Express with Handlebars, Bcrypt and Session. 
-Sequelize
-MySQL2
-Heroku

Also utilizes Eslint with Prettier and dotenv. All of which is handled by node.

## Using the MVC mindset

I will say in my journey in learning to code, I apprecate the control ( pun alert ) this type of methodolgy affords.
